Challenge submissions for reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer

The DailyProgrammer Subreddit has some interesting looking challenges! I'll be trying my hand at them from time to time and dropping the results here.

I started working in C# recently and this seems like a good way to practice. That said, comments and criticism are greatly appreciated! Feel free to tear my code apart and let me know how I can improve it. Thanks!
