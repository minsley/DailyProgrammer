Challenge submissions for http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer

The DailyProgrammer Subreddit has some interesting looking challenges. I'll be trying my hand at them from time to time and dropping the results here.

I started working in C# recently and this seems like a good way to practice. Comments and criticism are greatly appreciated! Kindly tear my code apart and let me know how I can improve. Thanks!
